## II. Evaluating Information

Read information you find from **any** source with a critical eye. Consider these points when evaluating books, articles, and Web sites.

#### *Who?*

Who wrote it? What ideas is the author trying to promote? Does the author tend to favor one idea over others? How does the affect the conclusions drawn?

Check

- that the author's name is given
- where the author works – the author's affiliation or credentials
- who published the article or book
- the type of journal in which the article is published (hint: most scholarly research appears in journals that are refereed or reviewed by peers – often called "peer reviewed" journals)
- the reputation of the newspaper in which the article is published

#### *What?*

- Do the conclusions in the paper seem justified? Does the research make sense – i.e. if you were conducting this research, would you feel comfortable drawing the same conclusions based on the results?

#### *Where?*

Where's the information from? (see "Who?")

Check

- whether the research was done by the author ("primary" source) or whether the author is summarizing others' research ("secondary" source).
- Are sources cited (i.e. footnotes and/or a bibliography)?

#### *When?*

How old is the information?

Check the following:

- When was the article, book, or Web site written?
- When was the Web page last updated?
- Is it possible that there are newer statistics or research reports?
